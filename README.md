Vanguard Group

The company was incorporated in 1975 by John C. Bogle.

John C. Bogle wanted to create an ideology of ownership in which the investors of Vanguard Group, were in fact the owners; therefore, "Investor Ownership."

The Vanguard Group is funded via Investor Ownership. While the exact dollar amount of funding is unknown, as of 2022, Assets Under Management "AUM" at Vanguard were worth $8,400,000,000,000. (8.4 Trillion.)

While not direct with media outlets, Vanguard Group CEO "Mortimer J. Buckley" commented on Artificial Intelligence and the impact it will have on the world, specifically from the standpoint of cognitive activities and how they are "routine." In the past, The Vanguard Group has invested in Artificial Intelligence. (It should be noted that utilization of Artificial Intelligence in Vanguard has not directly been spoken of to the general public, yet, Bloomberg has uncovered the Vanguard Group's use of Artificial Intelligence dating back to 2018. As of February 2024, use of Artificial Intelligence in Quantitative Investment Strategies as well as Machine Learning.) In short, no notable issues are being faced, Vanguard is attempting to utilize Artificial Intelligence to remain a leader in the Investment market through early adaptation.

Vanguard's intended demographic is comprised of people with high-socioeconomic standing, who are willing to invest large sums of money for even larger returns. As of year-end 2023, Vanguard reported >50,000,000 investors. (This number, while correct, may not accurately reflect true "Investor Ownership," but may also include Vanguard's demographic of investors involved in Vanguard's ETF Venture.)

The Vanguard Group offers top-of-the-line, strategic investments for people of high-socioeconomic status. Due to this, Vanguard is able to invest large sums of capital to turn a high ROI for customers, while also taking a cut. In comparison to other investment firms and financial companies alike, many firms in the finance sector are unable to produce high ROI for customers and the firms themeselves. Firms with large capital are able to become known as "market movers" or "whales." These are these types of firms who invest millions or rvrn billion into acquisitions and markets alike which result in the entirety of a market moving in a certain direction; a great deal of market movement of advantage to these firms. Aside from this, firms of such high stature and "deep-pockets" are also able to perform lengthy and high-costing capital expenditures to their advantage. An example of this would be the R&D budget within Vanguard, opposed to a smaller firm.
